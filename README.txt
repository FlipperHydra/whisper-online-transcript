This project uses OpenAI Whisper an AI engine designed for audio transcription.

This code allows users to have their own locally hosted transcription model than can be used at anytime.

Future Plans:

I intend to add Diarization with timestamps to the files use WhisperX, a variatn of Whisper designed by Max Bain.
Modyfying the HTML, the current HTMl was generated by AI for poc.

This Repository also includes audio files for testing.
